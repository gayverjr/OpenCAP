__An open-source application for studying resonances in molecules__

OpenCAP is currently capable of processing quantum chemistry data in order to perform ‘perturbative’ complex absorbing potential calculations on metastable electronic states. These calculations are able to extract resonance position and width at the cost of a single bound-state electronic structure calculation. 

We currently support an interface with the OpenMolcas quantum chemistry package, which specializes in multi-reference wave functions. There is also an experimental interface with the Q-Chem package for Q-Chem developers. Please contact us directly if
you are interested in using OpenCAP in tandem with Q-Chem.

To see the documentation for our Python API, PyOpenCAP, please see our page <a href="https://gayverjropencap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a>.

For information on the interface with OpenMolcas, please see the <a href="molcas.html">OpenMolcas</a> page.

For information on constructing an input for OpenCAP, please see our <a href="input.html">input </a> page.

Developers interested in adding new functionality should consult the <a href="notes.html"> developers notes</a>
 to help get started.
