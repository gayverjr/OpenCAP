OpenMolcas
===========

OpenMolcas_ is an open-source quantum chemistry package which specializes 
in multiconfigurational approaches to electronic structure. OpenMolcas can be used in tandem 
with PyOpenCAP to perform complex absorbing potential (extended)multi-state complete active 
space second order perturbation theory [**CAP/(X)MS-CASPT2**] calculations, which have been 
shown to yield accurate energies and lifetimes for metastable electronic states. 
Here, we outline the steps of performing these calculations using OpenMolcas and PyOpenCAP. 
Some suggested readings are provided at the bottom of the page.

Preliminary: Prepare input orbitals
-----------------------------------
As with any multi-reference calculation, the choice of active space is crucial for CAP/(X)MS-CASPT2, 
and is most often guided by chemical intuition. We refer the reader to the OpenMolcas 
manual_ for how to prepare input orbitals for a state-averaged RASSCF calculation.

Step 1: Running the OpenMolcas calculation
------------------------------------------
**State-averaged RASSCF**

In order to utilize the Perturbative CAP approach, a multi-state excited state calculation must be performed.
In the RASSCF module, the keyword 'CIROOT' is used to activate state-averaged RASSCF calculations. 

.. code-block:: bash

	 &RASSCF
	 CIROOT = 10 10 1

**Export transition densities with RASSI**

To generate the one-particle densities required to construct the CAP matrix, the RASSI 
module must be executed with the TRD1 keyword activated. This keyword saves one-particle 
transition density matrices between each pair of RASSCF states as well as the one-particle 
density matrices for each state to a file titled $Jobname.rassi.h5.

.. code-block:: bash

	 &RASSI
	 TRD1

**Generate effective Hamiltonian with (X)MS-CASPT2**

The (X)MS-CASPT2 approach is required to generate an appropriate zeroth Hamiltonian for the 
perturbative CAP method. To activate (X)MS-CASPT2 in OpenMolcas, use the Multistate keyword in the CASPT2 
module.

.. code-block:: bash

	&CASPT2
	Multistate = all
	# or
	Xmultistate = all
	
**Reference energy**

There are multiple strategies for obtaining the reference energy used to define the resonance 
position. For anionic resonances, one such strategy is to add an additional diffuse orbital to the active space in order to
mimic ionization, which obtains the resonance and the ground state of the neutral molecule 
in a single calculation [Kunitsa2017]_. Another strategy (which was used in the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`) 
is to calculate the ground state of the neutral molecule with CASCI/CASPT2 using the optimized orbitals of the 
anionic state.  


Step 2: Importing the data to PyOpenCAP
---------------------------------------

**System object**

To run a PyOpenCAP calculation, the geometry and basis set must be imported into a :class:`~pyopencap.System` 
object. The constructor takes in a Python dictionary as an argument. The relevant
keywords are discussed here, and more information is provided in the :ref:`keywords <keywords>` page.

*Rassi.h5*

The rassi.h5 file which contains the one-particle densities also contains the geometry 
and basis set information. To read in from rassi, "molcas_rassi" must set as the value to
the key "molecule", and the path to the file must be set as the value to the key 
"basis_file". Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

	sys_dict = {"molecule": "molcas_rassi","basis_file": "path/to/rassi.h5"}
	my_system = pycap.System(sys_dict)
	
*Molden*

Molden files generated by OpenMolcas contain the geometry and basis set information. 
To read in from molden, "molden" must be set as the value to the key "molecule", and the 
path to the file must be set as the value to the key "basis_file". Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

	sys_dict = {"molecule": "molden","basis_file": "path/to/file.molden"}
	my_system = pycap.System(sys_dict)

*Inline(not recommended)*

The molecule and basis set can also be specified manually. The "molecule" keyword must 
be set to "read", and then an additional keyword "geometry:" must
be specified, with a string that contains the geometry in xyz format. The "basis_file" keyword 
must be set to a path to a basis set file formatted in Psi4 style, which can be downloaded from
the MolSSI BSE_. Other optional keyword for this section include "bohr_coordinates" and
cart_bf. Please see the :ref:`keywords <keywords>`. section for more details. Up to G-type 
functions are supported.

.. code-block:: python

    sys_dict = {"geometry":    '''N  0  0   1.039
                              N  0  0   -1.039
                              X   0  0   0.0''',
            		"molecule" : "read",
            		"basis_file":"path/to/basis.bas",
            		"cart_bf":"d",
            		"bohr_coordinates:": "true"}
    my_system = pycap.System(sys_dict)	

.. _BSE: https://www.basissetexchange.org/

**One particle densities/zeroth order Hamiltonian**

The CAP matrix is computed by the :class:`~pyopencap.CAP` object. The constructor 
requires a :class:`~pyopencap.System`, a dictionary containing the CAP parameters, the number of states,
and finally the string "openmolcas", which denotes the ordering of the atomic orbital basis
set. An example is provided below. Please see the keywords section for more information on
the CAP parameters.
  
.. code-block:: python

    cap_dict = {"cap_type": "box",
            	"cap_x":"2.76",
            	"cap_y":"2.76",
            	"cap_z":"4.88",
            	"Radial_precision": "14",
            	"angular_points": "110"}
    pc = pycap.CAP(my_system,cap_dict,10,"openmolcas")

Before we can compute the CAP matrix in the state basis, we must load in the density matrices.
There are two ways of doing this. The first is to use the :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.read_data` function. 
As shown below, we define a dictionary which contains the following keys: "method" 
(electronic structure method chosen), "rassi_h5"(density matrices), and "molcas_output"(output file containing effective Hamiltonian).
The effective Hamiltonian can be retrieved using the :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.get_H` function of the :class:`~pyopencap.CAP` object. Currently, only the
effective Hamiltonians from (X)MS-CASPT2 calculations can be parsed from an OpenMolcas output file. 
We note that when :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.read_data` is used, our code symmetrizes the 
CAP matrix in the state basis.

.. code-block:: python
	
    es_dict = {"method" : "ms-caspt2",
           "molcas_output":"path/to/output.out",
           "rassi_h5":"path/to/rassi.h5"}
    pc.read_data(es_dict)
    # save the effective Hamiltonian for later use
    h0 = pc.get_H()

Alternatively, one can load in the densities one at a time using :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.add_tdm`.
In our examples below, we load in the matrices from rassi.h5 using the h5py package, and then
pass them as numpy arrays to the :class:`~pyopencap.CAP` object.

.. code-block:: python
	
    import h5py
    f = h5py.File('path/to/rassi.h5', 'r')
    dms = f["SFS_TRANSITION_DENSITIES"]
    # spin traced
    nbasis = int(np.sqrt(dms.shape[2]))
    for i in range(0,10):
        for j in range(i,10):
            dm = 0.5*np.reshape(dms[i][j],(nbasis,nbasis))
            pc.add_tdm(dm,i,j,"openmolcas","path/to/rassi.h5")
            # usually a good idea to symmetrize       
            if i!=j:
                pc.add_tdm(dm,,j,i,"openmolcas","path/to/rassi.h5")
 


Step 3: Computing the CAP matrix
--------------------------------
Once all of the densities are loaded, the CAP matrix is computed 
using :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.compute_perturb_cap`. The matrix can be retrieved using :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.get_perturb_cap`.

.. code-block:: python

    pc.compute_perturb_cap()
    W_mat=pc.get_perturb_cap()
    
*Note:*

When using cartesian d, f, or g-type basis functions, special care must be taken to ensure that the normalization 
conventions match what is used by OpenMolcas. In these cases, :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.compute_ao_cap` 
and then :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.renormalize` or :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.renormalize_cap` 
should be invoked before calling :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.compute_perturb_cap`.

.. code-block:: python

    pc.compute_ao_cap()
    pc.renormalize()
    pc.compute_perturb_cap()


Step 4: Generate eigenvalue trajectories
----------------------------------------
Extracting resonance position and width requires analysis of the eigenvalue trajectories. 
Template scripts are provided in the repository_. Development of automated tools 
for trajectory analysis is a subject of future work.

Officially supported methods
----------------------------
The following methods have been benchmarked, and the :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.read_data` function is capable of parsing 
output files to obtain the zeroth order Hamiltonian.

* MS-CASPT2
* XMS-CASPT2

Untested (use at your own risk!)
--------------------------------
The following methods are capable of dumping densities using the TRD1 keyword of the RASSI module, 
but have not been benchmarked for any systems, and the zeroth order Hamiltonian cannot be parsed
from the output file using the :func:`~pyopencap.CAP.read_data` function. Use at your own caution, and please contact us if you
find success using any of these methods so we can add official support!
